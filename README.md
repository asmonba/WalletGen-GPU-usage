# WalletGen – Fast Crypto Wallet Generator & Balance Finder (BTC / ETH / BNB / EVM)

**WalletGen** is a high-performance cryptocurrency wallet generator and balance finder for **Bitcoin (BTC)** and **EVM-based blockchains** like **Ethereum (ETH)**, **BNB**, **Polygon (MATIC)** and more.  
Built in C++ for maximum speed, it allows you to generate wallets, brute-force seed phrases, and search for lost crypto wallets with active balances.

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: WalletGen is a research and educational tool. It is not intended for unauthorized access or malicious activity. Use it responsibly and only with wallets you own or have permission to access.

## How It Works

WalletGen generates random or deterministic seed phrases and converts them into wallet addresses using BIP39, BIP44, and Bech32 (for BTC) or keccak256 (for EVM).

The software compares generated addresses against known address databases or checks balances in real-time via public blockchain explorers. 

Wallet Gen is built in C++ and is open-source, allowing anyone to access and modify the code. Compared to Python-based wallet generators, Wallet Gen boasts significantly higher wallet generation speeds, with performance primarily relying on your CPU & GPU.


## Features

- **Generation of cryptocurrency wallets**: Wallet Gen supports creating single wallets for Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, MATIC and other cryptocurrencies.
- **Search for wallets with balance**: Using bruteforce techniques, Wallet Gen allows you to search for existing wallets with balances in both the Bitcoin network and EVMs.
- **Support for various algorithms**: Keccak256 algorithm for EVM wallets and BIP39, BIP44, Bech32 algorithm for Bitcoin are used for wallet generation.
- **Using a database to speed up searches**: Download and use databases to search for balance wallets, speeding up the process tenfold.
- **High speed of operation**: Wallet Gen utilizes the power of the CPU and GPU to achieve the best performance.

# Searching for Crypto Wallets

**Wallet Gen** allows you to search using brute force method for two types of crypto wallets with an existing balance. To search for BTC wallets, press key `3` in the menu or run `start_search_btc.bat`. For searching EVM wallets (such as Ethereum, BNB, etc.), press key `4` in the menu or run `start_search_evm.bat`. 

The search speed is determined by your hardware, especially your graphics card. To increase your chances of finding a wallet with a balance, you can run multiple instances of the program, from 1 to 4, depending on the power of your graphics card.

## My Finds

I’ve personally recovered two BTC wallets with a balance. The first had 0.000032 BTC, the second contained 0.0528 BTC (roughly $4800 at the time of discovery).  
Here’s the link to the wallet: [bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay](https://mempool.space/address/bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay).

### New Find 4/9/2025

After a week of non-stop wallet searching, I finally found a [wallet](https://mempool.space/address/bc1q29c5m3w4jxtsj4vcd2ccw4t68xm8m7vs5vytu0) with 0.25 bitcoin ($19k). This is my 4th and biggest find of all time.
